# UB-ANC-Agent
The agent software template for UB-ANC, an open test-bed platform for airborne networking and communications

-----------------------------------

This is a template and starting point of agent software in UB-ANC. The code just does a simple takeoff, loiter, and land mission. It also send a command to the next agent to start its mission. The UB-ANC Emulator can be used to reduce the edit, compile, and debug cycle of agent software.
